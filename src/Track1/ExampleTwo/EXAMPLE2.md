## Explanation of this example
A variable is a placeholder for storing a value of particular type: a string, a number, or something else. Every variable has a name (also known as an identifier) to distinguish it from others. Before you start using a variable, you must declare it.

Example: 
DataType variableName = initialization; 
The left part of this statement describes the variable, and the right part describes something that is assigned to it.

•	The type (or data type) of a variable determines what possible operations can be performed on the variable and which values can be stored in it. Here we use a non-existing data (DataType) to demonstrate the general form of declaration.
•	The name (or identifier) distinguishes the variable from others. The name of variable cannot start with a digit; it usually starts with a letter. Always try to choose meaningful and readable names for variables to make your code easy to understand.
•	The assignment operator denoted as = is used to assign a single value or a result of an expression to a variable.
•	The initialization is a value or a result of an expression that is assigned to the variable.
