## Getting Started

The purpose of this java project is to demonstrate the Java language. We are using the Oracle: Java The Complete Reference 11th edition by Herbert Schildt (not associated with this project) as a guide for educational purposes. In normal development, Apps/Programs are developed with many files, that in layman's terms, "piggy-back" off each other to form one fully operational application. What is quite often forgotten is that many of the files in those apps/programs are individual apps/programs themselves that perform a task.

For example, I might have an app that will contain a java file that serves as the entry point for the application, such as App.java. Next, I may have a file called person.java, well person.java will contain all the necessary building blocks that will only deal with the Person class that the App.java file will use. 

If any sample code requires these complex structures, it will be defined in a subfolder located in the src folder.

I hope this project can grow for those from beginners to advanced learners.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `src/ExampleOne`: the subfolder to maintain learning track 1
- - `src/ExampleTwo`: the subfolder to maintain learning track 1
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
